# Wildfires-Prediction-across-United-States Due to Climate Change


1.	Description
Wildfires are some of the most dangerous effects humanity is facing right now due to climate change. Every year, there are hundreds and thousands of wildfires reported across the world, causing huge economical losses. Resulting in an overall economic imbalance in world markets and trading. 

2.	Objectives
•	My project aim is to provide insights on wildfires, their causes, and their behaviors.
•	Aim is to provide useful recommendations to increase public safety and minimize the economic damage from potential future wildfires
•	I will analyze the geographical information on where and when the wildfires occurred which could provide useful information to identify high-risk areas that are vulnerable to wildfires.
•	My project findings will help make better strategies on where firefighters’ departments are located and how to respond on time.
•	I will find/predict the causes and risks of wildfires that can help plan preventive measures in future
•	Increasing public understanding of wildfires can help prevent future losses and save billions of dollars

3.	Problem

•	Wildfires are costly, and firefighting is also costly. There are approx.. 75000+ wildfires per annum in the US on average
•	400 billion of total economic loss in 2018 from wildfires in California.
•	16.5 billion is lost from the costliest wildfires in 2018.
•	Most Wildfires in the US are caused by humans.
•	Most Destructive Wildfires are caused by Nature.

4.	Solution
•	Interactive maps to visualize the historical fire data.
•	There should be Statistical Analysis to reveal frequencies, trends, and correlations
•	I will apply some Machine learning models to predict the causes and risks of wildfires.

5.	Dataset 

The data set is from USDA forest services 1992-2015

6.	Techniques
•	Data Collection and Data Cleaning: by using NOAA API, wildfire dataset from US forecast service.
•	EDA and Data visualization: using SciPy, SKlearn, Matplotlib, Plotly, folium, Seaborn
•	Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, creating Gaussian Classifier.
